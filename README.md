# Analyzing-the-Pattern-Sales-between-The-Products

## Overview
Welcome to the Online Retail Sales Pattern Analysis repository! This project delves into the exploration of product associations within an online retail dataset. The primary focus is on uncovering patterns in customer behavior by analyzing products frequently purchased together. Leveraging Association Rule Mining techniques, we aim to extract valuable insights that shed light on customer preferences and purchasing trends.

## Features
-	**Gather Data:** Kaggle was utilized to gather information about the subject.
-	**Analyze the Data:** The data was studied using a variety of analytical methodologies such as correlation, shape, mean, and others to find hidden patterns and interactions between distinct elements.
-	**Data Visualization:** The evaluated result was shown to make the hidden links and patterns in the data easier to understand.
-	**Data Transformation:** Data transformation is the process of changing data from one format to another, usually from a source system's format to a destination system's needed format.
-	**Association Mining:** The goal of association rule mining is to discover the rules that control how and why certain products/items are frequently purchased together.
-	**Pattern Evaluation:** Determine the pattern's level of interest. To make data understandable to the user, summarization and visualization are used.
